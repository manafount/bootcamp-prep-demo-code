Hey ___!

Great job! You scored 4/5. 

Your code is mostly correct and it's clear you understand the material included in this assessment.

Moving forward, try to work on writing clean, legibile code if you find yourself with extra time.
When working on a team, it's important to have consistent "code quality". Even for solo projects 
it can be super beneficial in terms of re-familiarizing yourself with pieces of code that you may not
remember writing.

Specifically, remember to end your javascript expressions with a semicolon (;). Most modern
day javascript interpreters will add a semicolon to locations where they might be missing, but it's
not a great idea to trust that fallback with all of your code.

It may help to install a javascript 'linter'. A linter will warn you when you make certain stylistic
mistakes, without breaking of having any adverse effects on your actual code.

You can find my comments on lines ending with '-MK'.

/*******************************************************************************
Write a function highestScore(students) that takes in an array of student objects
as a parameter. It should return a string that corresponds to the student with
the highest score. The string should contain that student's initials
concatenated with their id. Assume the array contains at least 1 student object and
the student with the highest score is unique (there are no ties).
Example:

var students = [
 {name: 'Alvin Zablan', id: 128, score: -42},
 {name: 'Eliot Bradshaw', id: 32, score: 57},
 {name: 'Tommy Duek', id: 2, score: 99},
 {name: 'Fred Sladkey', id: 256, score: 94}
];

highestScore(students); //=> 'TD2'
*******************************************************************************/

function highestScore(students) {
  var highest = 0 // remember to end expressions with a semi-colon! -MK
  for (var i = 0; i = students.lengthl; i++){

  }

}
